## DOTNET

<details>
  <summary>What is the .NET framework?</summary>
  <br>
  The .NET framework is a software development platform developed by Microsoft. It provides a comprehensive and consistent programming model for building Windows applications.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Explain the role of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in .NET.</summary>
  <br>
  CLR is the execution environment of the .NET framework. It manages code execution, provides services such as memory management and exception handling, and ensures language interoperability.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Discuss the significance of the Common Type System (CTS) in .NET.</summary>
  <br>
  CTS defines the data types and programming constructs that can be used in .NET. It ensures type compatibility between languages, enabling seamless integration and communication.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Explain the purpose of the Intermediate Language (IL) in the .NET framework.</summary>
  <br>
  IL is an intermediate code generated by the .NET compiler. It is platform-agnostic and serves as a common language for all .NET languages. During runtime, IL is translated into machine code by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Discuss the differences between Managed Code and Unmanaged Code in .NET.</summary>
  <br>
  Managed code runs in a managed environment (like CLR), providing automatic memory management and enhanced security. Unmanaged code, on the other hand, lacks such features and directly interacts with the system's memory.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the Assembly in .NET and what does it contain?</summary>
  <br>
  An assembly is a fundamental unit of deployment in .NET. It contains compiled code, metadata, and resources needed for the application. Assemblies can be shared and versioned.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Explain the role of the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler in .NET.</summary>
  <br>
  The JIT compiler translates Intermediate Language (IL) code into machine code at runtime. This improves performance by adapting the code to the specific characteristics of the underlying hardware.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the benefits of using the Garbage Collector in .NET?</summary>
  <br>
  The Garbage Collector automatically manages memory, reclaiming unused resources. This prevents memory leaks and enhances application reliability and performance.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Discuss the role of Globalization and Localization features in .NET.</summary>
  <br>
  Globalization involves designing applications to support multiple cultures and regions. Localization is the process of adapting an application to a specific culture or region. .NET provides features to facilitate both aspects.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the purpose of the Common Language Specification (CLS) in .NET?</summary>
  <br>
  CLS defines a set of rules that .NET languages must adhere to for interoperability. It ensures that code written in one .NET language can be used by other .NET languages seamlessly.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is ADO.NET, and how does it differ from classic ADO?</summary>
  <br>
  ADO.NET is a data access technology in .NET, providing a disconnected and efficient way to interact with databases. It differs from classic ADO by introducing DataSet and DataReader components, enhancing data manipulation and retrieval.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Explain the concept of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) in .NET.</summary>
  <br>
  WCF is a framework for building distributed and interoperable services in .NET. It enables communication between applications using various protocols and supports features like security, transactions, and messaging.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Discuss the role of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) in .NET.</summary>
  <br>
  WPF is a UI framework in .NET for creating rich desktop applications. It separates the UI from the underlying logic, supports data binding, and allows for flexible and visually appealing user interfaces.
  <br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the significance of the Entity Framework in .NET?</summary>
  <br>
  The Entity Framework is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework in .NET. It simplifies database interactions by enabling developers to work with data in terms of strongly typed .NET objects, reducing the need for manual SQL queries.
