1. **Planning Poker:** 
- Planning Poker is a consensus-based estimation technique used to estimate the relative size of user stories or tasks.
- Team members use a deck of Planning Poker cards with values representing different levels of effort or complexity (e.g., Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, etc.).
- During a Planning Poker session, the Product Owner presents a user story, and team members individually select a card representing their estimate.
- After everyone has chosen a card, team members reveal their estimates simultaneously.
- If there are discrepancies in estimates, team members discuss the factors influencing their estimates and repeat the process until a consensus is reached. 
2. **Relative Sizing (Comparative Estimation):** 
- Relative sizing involves comparing the size, effort, or complexity of one user story or task relative to another.
- Teams use a reference story (often called a "benchmark" or "anchor") as a baseline and compare other stories to it.
- For example, if Story A is considered twice as complex as the reference story, it would be given an estimate of 2 story points.
- Relative sizing is a quick and intuitive way to estimate user stories and can be particularly useful when using Planning Poker. 
3. **T-Shirt Sizes:** 
- T-Shirt sizing is a simple and intuitive estimation technique that uses sizes (e.g., XS, S, M, L, XL) to represent the relative size or complexity of user stories.
- Team members assign a T-shirt size to each user story based on its perceived effort or complexity, relative to other stories.
- T-Shirt sizing is less precise than numeric estimates but can be helpful for high-level estimation or when detailed estimates are not necessary. 
4. **Dot Voting:** 
- Dot voting is a technique used to prioritize backlog items or features based on team consensus.
- Team members are given a certain number of votes (represented by dots) and use them to indicate their priorities.
- The items with the most votes are prioritized higher on the backlog.
- Dot voting can be used in conjunction with other estimation techniques to prioritize backlog items based on both effort and value. 
5. **Bucket System:** 
- The Bucket System is a technique that categorizes user stories or tasks into buckets based on their complexity or effort.
- Buckets are predefined ranges of values (e.g., 1-3, 4-7, 8-12) representing different levels of effort or complexity.
- Team members assign each user story to the appropriate bucket based on their judgment of its complexity.
- The Bucket System provides a quick and simple way to estimate user stories without the need for detailed numeric estimates.

These Agile estimation techniques help teams to collaboratively estimate work items, prioritize backlog items, and plan iterations effectively. The choice of technique may depend on factors such as team size, project complexity, and organizational culture. Experimenting with different techniques and adapting them to suit the team's needs can lead to more accurate and efficient estimation processes.
