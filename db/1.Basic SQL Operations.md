# Complete Guide to Basic SQL Operations

## 📚 **COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE BASE**

### **1. SELECT Statement Fundamentals**

**Core Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Projection**: Selecting specific columns
- **Selection**: Filtering rows (using WHERE)
- **Execution Order**: FROM → WHERE → SELECT

**Common Patterns:**
```sql
-- Select all columns
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees;

-- Select with expressions
SELECT first_name, salary * 12 as annual_salary FROM employees;
```

### **2. WHERE Clause Deep Dive**

**Basic Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition;
```

**Operator Categories:**
- **Comparison**: =, <>, <, >, <=, >=
- **Logical**: AND, OR, NOT
- **Range**: BETWEEN, IN
- **Pattern**: LIKE
- **Null**: IS NULL, IS NOT NULL

## 🔍 **CORNER CASES & TRICKY SCENARIOS**

### **1. NULL Value Handling**

**Tricky Scenario:**
```sql
-- This WON'T work as expected
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary = NULL;

-- Correct approach
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NULL;
```

**Why it's tricky:** NULL represents unknown value, so `= NULL` always returns NULL (treated as false)

**Follow-up Question:** "Why can't we use = NULL for null comparisons?"

**Expected Answer:** NULL is not a value but represents missing/unknown data. Equality comparisons with NULL always return NULL, which is treated as false in WHERE clauses.

### **2. String Comparison Case Sensitivity**

**Tricky Scenario:**
```sql
-- Might return different results based on database collation
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'john';
```

**Corner Case:** Database collation affects string comparisons. Some databases are case-sensitive by default.

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Case-insensitive comparison
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE LOWER(first_name) = LOWER('john');
```

### **3. Date Comparisons**

**Tricky Scenario:**
```sql
-- This might not work if hire_date has time component
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date = '2023-01-01';
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Better approach for date-only comparison
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date >= '2023-01-01' 
                         AND hire_date < '2023-01-02';
```

## ❓ **TRICKY INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

### **Question 1: "What's the difference between WHERE and HAVING?"**

**What they're testing:** Understanding of SQL execution order and aggregation.

**Expected Answer:**
"WHERE filters rows BEFORE aggregation, while HAVING filters groups AFTER aggregation. WHERE cannot use aggregate functions, but HAVING can."

**Example:**
```sql
-- WHERE: Filter employees before counting
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 50000          -- Filters individual rows
GROUP BY department;

-- HAVING: Filter departments after counting
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;         -- Filters grouped results
```

### **Question 2: "Why use column aliases and when can't you use them in WHERE?"**

**What they're testing:** Understanding of SQL execution order.

**Expected Answer:**
"Column aliases are defined in the SELECT phase, which executes AFTER the WHERE phase. Therefore, you can't reference aliases in WHERE clauses."

**Example:**
```sql
-- This WON'T work:
SELECT first_name, salary * 12 as annual_salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE annual_salary > 60000;  -- Error: alias not recognized

-- This WORKS:
SELECT first_name, salary * 12 as annual_salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary * 12 > 60000;    -- Use original expression
```

### **Question 3: "What's the difference between DISTINCT and GROUP BY with no aggregates?"**

**What they're testing:** Understanding of duplicate removal mechanisms.

**Expected Answer:**
"Both can remove duplicates, but DISTINCT is clearer for simple duplicate removal. GROUP BY is meant for aggregation, though it can remove duplicates when used without aggregate functions."

**Example:**
```sql
-- Both return unique departments
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;

SELECT department FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

**Performance Note:** They might be similar, but it depends on the database optimizer.

## 🎯 **COMMON PATTERNS & APPROACHES**

### **Pattern 1: Conditional Selection with CASE in SELECT**

**Use Case:** Display different values based on conditions without filtering rows.

```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary > 100000 THEN 'High'
        WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END as salary_grade
FROM employees;
```

**Interview Question:** "When would you use CASE in SELECT vs WHERE?"

**Answer:** "CASE in SELECT transforms output values, while WHERE filters rows. Use CASE when you want to categorize data for display, and WHERE when you want to exclude rows entirely."

### **Pattern 2: Combining Multiple Conditions**

**Complex WHERE clauses require careful logic:**

```sql
-- Correct grouping of OR conditions
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE (department = 'IT' OR department = 'HR')
  AND salary > 50000;

-- Common mistake: missing parentheses
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'IT' OR department = 'HR' AND salary > 50000;
-- This evaluates as: department = 'IT' OR (department = 'HR' AND salary > 50000)
```

### **Pattern 3: LIMIT/TOP for Sampling and Pagination**

**Different database syntax:**
```sql
-- MySQL/PostgreSQL
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 10;

-- SQL Server
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Oracle
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC 
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
```

**Interview Question:** "How would you implement pagination with LIMIT?"

**Answer:** "Use LIMIT with OFFSET: `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20` for page 3 (skip 20, take 10). But for large datasets, seek method with WHERE clause is more efficient."

## 🔄 **FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO EXPECT**

### **Follow-up 1: "What's the execution order of a SQL query?"**

**Expected Answer:**
"FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY → LIMIT"

**Why this matters:** Understanding this explains why you can't use aliases in WHERE but can in ORDER BY.

### **Follow-up 2: "How does NULL affect arithmetic operations?"**

**Expected Answer:**
"Any arithmetic operation with NULL returns NULL. For example: `10 + NULL = NULL`, `NULL * 5 = NULL`"

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT salary, bonus, salary + bonus as total 
FROM employees;
-- If bonus is NULL, total will be NULL
```

### **Follow-up 3: "What's the difference between != and <>?"**

**Expected Answer:**
"They are functionally equivalent - both mean 'not equal'. It's a matter of personal/coding standard preference."

## 🚨 **PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS**

### **1. SELECT * vs Specific Columns**

**Bad Practice:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;  -- Returns all columns
```

**Better Practice:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department FROM employees;
```

**Why:** Reduces network traffic and memory usage. Also safer if table schema changes.

### **2. WHERE Clause Optimization**

**Inefficient:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE YEAR(hire_date) = 2023;
```

**Efficient:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE hire_date >= '2023-01-01' AND hire_date < '2024-01-01';
```

**Why:** The first prevents index usage due to function on column.

## 💡 **ADVANCED CORNER CASES**

### **1. Boolean Algebra in WHERE Clauses**

**Tricky Scenario:**
```sql
-- What happens with multiple NOT conditions?
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE NOT (department = 'IT' AND salary > 50000);

-- Equivalent to:
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE department <> 'IT' OR salary <= 50000;
```

**Interview Question:** "How would you rewrite a complex NOT condition using De Morgan's laws?"

### **2. Three-Valued Logic with NULL**

**Understanding TRUE/FALSE/UNKNOWN:**
```sql
-- These all return UNKNOWN (treated as FALSE):
WHERE NULL = NULL
WHERE NULL = 5
WHERE NULL <> 5

-- These return TRUE:
WHERE NULL IS NULL
WHERE 5 IS NOT NULL
```

## 🧪 **PRACTICE EXERCISES**

### **Exercise 1: Fix the Query**
```sql
-- Original (has issues):
SELECT first_name, salary * 1.1 as new_salary
FROM employees
WHERE new_salary > 60000
ORDER BY department;

-- Fixed version:
SELECT first_name, salary * 1.1 as new_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary * 1.1 > 60000
ORDER BY department;
```

### **Exercise 2: Complex Conditions**
"Write a query to find employees in IT or HR departments, with salary between 50k and 100k, but exclude anyone hired before 2020."

**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department, salary, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE (department = 'IT' OR department = 'HR')
  AND salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000
  AND hire_date >= '2020-01-01';
```
