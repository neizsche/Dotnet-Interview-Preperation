# **Set Operations: Complete Mastery Guide**

## 📚 **Detailed Knowledge Base**

### **1. UNION & UNION ALL**

#### **Basic Syntax**
```sql
-- UNION (removes duplicates)
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;

-- UNION ALL (keeps duplicates)
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
```

#### **Key Characteristics**
- **Column Compatibility**: Columns must match in number, data type, and order
- **Column Names**: Uses column names from the first SELECT statement
- **Sorting**: Can only have one ORDER BY clause at the end
- **Performance**: UNION ALL is faster as it doesn't remove duplicates

#### **Execution Process**
1. Execute all SELECT statements
2. Combine results into a single result set
3. **UNION**: Remove duplicates + sort (implicit sorting for duplicate removal)
4. **UNION ALL**: Simply concatenate results

### **2. INTERSECT**

#### **Basic Syntax**
```sql
-- Returns common rows from both queries
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
```

#### **Key Characteristics**
- Returns only distinct rows that exist in both result sets
- Requires same number and compatible data types of columns
- **NULL handling**: NULL = NULL returns TRUE in INTERSECT operations

### **3. EXCEPT/MINUS**

#### **Basic Syntax**
```sql
-- SQL Server, PostgreSQL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;

-- Oracle
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
MINUS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
```

#### **Key Characteristics**
- Returns distinct rows from first query that don't exist in second query
- **Order matters**: A EXCEPT B ≠ B EXCEPT A
- Set difference operation

## ⚠️ **Corner Cases & Tricky Scenarios**

### **1. NULL Handling in Set Operations**
```sql
-- Example: NULL behavior in INTERSECT
SELECT NULL AS col1 FROM dual
INTERSECT
SELECT NULL AS col1 FROM dual;
-- Returns: NULL (because NULL = NULL in set operations)

-- vs. NULL behavior in WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM table WHERE NULL = NULL;
-- Returns: Empty set (because NULL = NULL is UNKNOWN)
```

**Interviewer's Point**: Tests understanding of NULL handling differences between set operations and regular comparisons.

### **2. Data Type Compatibility Issues**
```sql
-- This will FAIL
SELECT '100' AS number_col FROM dual
UNION
SELECT 100 AS number_col FROM dual;
-- Error: Data type mismatch

-- This works (implicit conversion)
SELECT '100' AS number_col FROM dual
UNION
SELECT CAST(100 AS VARCHAR) AS number_col FROM dual;
```

### **3. Column Name Precedence**
```sql
SELECT id AS employee_id, name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers;
-- Result columns will be: employee_id, name
```

### **4. ORDER BY Limitations**
```sql
-- WRONG: ORDER BY in individual queries
SELECT id, name FROM table1 ORDER BY name
UNION
SELECT id, name FROM table2 ORDER BY name;

-- CORRECT: Single ORDER BY at the end
SELECT id, name FROM table1
UNION
SELECT id, name FROM table2
ORDER BY name;
```

## 🎯 **Tricky Interview Questions & Answers**

### **Question 1: Performance Comparison**
**Q**: "When would you use UNION instead of UNION ALL, and what's the performance impact?"

**What Interviewer Seeks**: Understanding of performance implications and appropriate use cases.

**Answer**:
```sql
-- Use UNION ALL when you know there are no duplicates or duplicates are acceptable
-- Much faster as it avoids duplicate removal and sorting
SELECT product_id FROM current_products
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id FROM archived_products;

-- Use UNION only when you need distinct results
SELECT customer_email FROM website_signups
UNION
SELECT customer_email FROM store_registrations;
-- Removes duplicate emails across both sources
```

**Performance Impact**: UNION requires sorting and duplicate removal (O(n log n)), UNION ALL is O(1) concatenation.

### **Question 2: INTERSECT vs INNER JOIN**
**Q**: "What's the difference between INTERSECT and INNER JOIN? When would you use each?"

**What Interviewer Seeks**: Understanding of set operations vs relational joins.

**Answer**:
```sql
-- INTERSECT: Finds common rows based on all columns
SELECT employee_id, department_id FROM current_assignments
INTERSECT
SELECT employee_id, department_id FROM previous_assignments;
-- Returns employees who had exactly the same assignment

-- INNER JOIN: Can join on specific columns
SELECT c.employee_id, c.department_id 
FROM current_assignments c
INNER JOIN previous_assignments p 
    ON c.employee_id = p.employee_id;
-- Returns all current employees who had any previous assignment
```

**Key Difference**: INTERSECT compares entire rows, JOIN matches on specified columns.

### **Question 3: EXCEPT with Multiple Columns**
**Q**: "How does EXCEPT handle multiple columns? Write a query to find employees in HR department who've never been managers."

**What Interviewer Seeks**: Ability to use EXCEPT with complex conditions.

**Answer**:
```sql
-- All HR employees
SELECT employee_id FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR'

EXCEPT

-- Employees who have been managers
SELECT manager_id FROM departments WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**Follow-up**: "What if we need to consider employee names too?"
```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'HR'

EXCEPT

SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.employee_id = d.manager_id;
```

### **Question 4: Set Operations with Aggregates**
**Q**: "Can you use GROUP BY with set operations? Write a query to find product categories that exist in both 2022 and 2023 sales."

**What Interviewer Seeks**: Understanding of combining aggregation with set operations.

**Answer**:
```sql
-- Categories with sales in 2022
SELECT category_id 
FROM sales 
WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2022
GROUP BY category_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0

INTERSECT

-- Categories with sales in 2023
SELECT category_id 
FROM sales 
WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2023
GROUP BY category_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0;
```

## 🔄 **Common Patterns & Approaches**

### **Pattern 1: Combining Data from Multiple Sources**
```sql
-- Monthly report combining online and in-store sales
SELECT 
    'Online' AS source,
    sale_date,
    amount 
FROM online_sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Store' AS source,
    sale_date,
    amount 
FROM store_sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'

ORDER BY sale_date, source;
```

### **Pattern 2: Finding Missing Data**
```sql
-- Products that have never been ordered
SELECT product_id FROM products

EXCEPT

SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM order_items;

-- Alternative using NOT EXISTS (interviewer might ask comparison)
SELECT product_id FROM products p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_items oi WHERE oi.product_id = p.product_id
);
```

### **Pattern 3: Data Validation & Integrity Checks**
```sql
-- Find inconsistent category assignments
SELECT product_id, category_name 
FROM product_categories

EXCEPT

SELECT product_id, category_name 
FROM validated_categories;
```

### **Pattern 4: Temporal Data Analysis**
```sql
-- Customers who purchased in Q1 but not in Q2
SELECT customer_id FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31'

EXCEPT

SELECT customer_id FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-04-01' AND '2023-06-30';
```

### **Pattern 5: Hierarchical Data Processing**
```sql
-- Get all managers and non-managers in one list
SELECT employee_id, 'Manager' AS role_type
FROM employees 
WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT manager_id FROM departments)

UNION ALL

SELECT employee_id, 'Individual Contributor' AS role_type
FROM employees 
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT manager_id FROM departments);
```

## 🧠 **Advanced Follow-up Questions**

### **Question 5: Set Operation Alternatives**
**Q**: "How would you implement UNION behavior using other SQL constructs?"

**What Interviewer Seeks**: Deep understanding of what set operations do internally.

**Answer**:
```sql
-- UNION equivalent using GROUP BY
SELECT column1, column2
FROM (
    SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2
) AS combined
GROUP BY column1, column2;

-- INTERSECT equivalent using EXISTS
SELECT DISTINCT t1.column1, t1.column2
FROM table1 t1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM table2 t2 
    WHERE t2.column1 = t1.column1 
    AND t2.column2 = t1.column2
);
```

### **Question 6: Performance Optimization**
**Q**: "You have a UNION query that's slow. How would you optimize it?"

**What Interviewer Seeks**: Practical performance tuning skills.

**Answer Strategy**:
1. **Check if UNION ALL can be used instead**
2. **Add indexes on columns used in WHERE clauses of individual SELECTs**
3. **Consider materialized views for frequently used unions**
4. **Use temporary tables for complex operations**
```sql
-- Optimization example
CREATE INDEX idx_table1_date ON table1(date_column);
CREATE INDEX idx_table2_date ON table2(date_column);

SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT columns FROM table1 WHERE date_column > '2023-01-01'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT columns FROM table2 WHERE date_column > '2023-01-01'
) AS combined
GROUP BY columns;  -- Manual duplicate removal if needed
```

### **Question 7: NULL Handling Deep Dive**
**Q**: "How do set operations handle multiple NULL values? Write a test case."

**What Interviewer Seeks**: Understanding of three-valued logic in SQL.

**Answer**:
```sql
-- Test case
WITH set1 AS (SELECT NULL AS col1, 'A' AS col2),
     set2 AS (SELECT NULL AS col1, 'A' AS col2)
     
SELECT * FROM set1
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM set2;
-- Returns: (NULL, 'A') - NULLs are considered equal in set operations

-- This is DIFFERENT from:
SELECT * FROM set1 s1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM set2 s2 
    WHERE s1.col1 = s2.col1 AND s1.col2 = s2.col2
);
-- Returns: Empty set (because NULL = NULL is UNKNOWN)
```

## 📊 **Real-World Scenarios for Practice**

### **Scenario 1: E-commerce Data Consolidation**
```sql
-- Combine new and returning customer metrics
SELECT 
    'New_Customers' AS metric_type,
    COUNT(*) AS count_value,
    MONTH(registration_date) AS period
FROM customers 
WHERE registration_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY MONTH(registration_date)

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Returning_Customers' AS metric_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS count_value, 
    MONTH(order_date) AS period
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY MONTH(order_date)

ORDER BY period, metric_type;
```

### **Scenario 2: Employee Skills Matrix**
```sql
-- Find skills needed for project but missing in team
SELECT skill_id FROM project_requirements WHERE project_id = 101

EXCEPT

SELECT skill_id FROM employee_skills 
WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM project_assignments WHERE project_id = 101);
```

### **Scenario 3: Data Migration Validation**
```sql
-- Verify all data migrated successfully (symmetric difference)
-- Records in source but not in target
SELECT customer_id FROM legacy_system

EXCEPT

SELECT customer_id FROM new_system

UNION ALL

-- Records in target but not in source (should be empty)
SELECT customer_id FROM new_system

EXCEPT

SELECT customer_id FROM legacy_system;
```
