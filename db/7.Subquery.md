# Complete Guide to SQL Subqueries - Mastery Package

## 📚 **SUBQUERY FUNDAMENTALS DOCUMENTATION**

### **What is a Subquery?**
A subquery (inner query or nested query) is a SQL query nested inside another SQL query (outer query). Subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

### **Basic Syntax Structure**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
WHERE column1 OPERATOR (
    SELECT column1 
    FROM table2 
    WHERE condition
);
```

## 🔍 **DETAILED SUBQUERY TYPES KNOWLEDGE BASE**

### **1. Scalar Subqueries**
**Definition:** Returns exactly one row and one column (single value).

**Characteristics:**
- Must return only one value
- Used wherever a single value is expected
- Can be used in SELECT, WHERE, and HAVING clauses

**Example Patterns:**
```sql
-- In SELECT clause
SELECT 
    EmployeeName,
    Salary,
    (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees;

-- In WHERE clause
SELECT EmployeeName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);

-- In HAVING clause
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

**Corner Cases & Pitfalls:**
- ❌ **Error:** Subquery returns more than one row
- ❌ **Error:** Subquery returns no rows (returns NULL)
- ✅ **Solution:** Ensure subquery returns exactly one row

### **2. Correlated Subqueries**
**Definition:** Subquery that references columns from the outer query. Executed once for each row processed by the outer query.

**Key Insight:** The inner query depends on the outer query.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Find employees who earn more than their department average
SELECT e1.EmployeeName, e1.Salary, e1.Department
FROM Employees e1
WHERE e1.Salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.Salary)
    FROM Employees e2
    WHERE e2.Department = e1.Department  -- Correlation
);
```

**Performance Characteristics:**
- ⚠️ **Slower** than non-correlated subqueries
- Executes once for each row in outer query
- Use indexes on correlated columns for better performance

### **3. Non-Correlated Subqueries**
**Definition:** Independent subquery that can execute without the outer query.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Find employees in specific departments
SELECT EmployeeName, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Department IN (
    SELECT DepartmentName 
    FROM Departments 
    WHERE Location = 'New York'
);
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Executes only once
- ✅ Better performance than correlated subqueries
- ✅ Easier to optimize

### **4. EXISTS/NOT EXISTS Subqueries**
**Definition:** Used to test for existence of rows in subquery. Returns TRUE if subquery returns at least one row.

**Syntax Patterns:**
```sql
-- EXISTS: Find departments that have employees
SELECT DepartmentName
FROM Departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Employees e 
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
);

-- NOT EXISTS: Find departments with no employees
SELECT DepartmentName
FROM Departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Employees e 
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
);
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Stops processing when first match found
- ✅ Better performance than IN for large datasets
- ✅ Handles NULL values correctly

### **5. IN/NOT IN Subqueries**
**Definition:** Tests if a value matches any value in a list returned by subquery.

**Examples:**
```sql
-- IN: Employees in specific departments
SELECT EmployeeName
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IN (
    SELECT DepartmentID 
    FROM Departments 
    WHERE Budget > 1000000
);

-- NOT IN: Employees not in specific departments
SELECT EmployeeName
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID NOT IN (
    SELECT DepartmentID 
    FROM Departments 
    WHERE Location = 'Remote'
);
```

**Critical NULL Handling Issue:**
```sql
-- DANGEROUS: NOT IN with NULL values
SELECT EmployeeName
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID NOT IN (
    SELECT DepartmentID 
    FROM Departments 
    WHERE Location = 'Remote'  -- If this returns NULL, entire query returns nothing!
);

-- SAFE: Use NOT EXISTS instead
SELECT EmployeeName
FROM Employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Departments d 
    WHERE d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID 
    AND d.Location = 'Remote'
);
```

### **6. ANY/SOME/ALL Operators**
**Definition:** Compare a value to each value in a list returned by subquery.

**Operators:**
- `= ANY` : Equivalent to IN
- `<> ALL` : Equivalent to NOT IN
- `> ANY` : Greater than at least one value
- `> ALL` : Greater than all values

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Employees earning more than any manager
SELECT EmployeeName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > ANY (
    SELECT Salary 
    FROM Employees 
    WHERE Title = 'Manager'
);

-- Employees earning more than all managers
SELECT EmployeeName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > ALL (
    SELECT Salary 
    FROM Employees 
    WHERE Title = 'Manager'
);
```

## 🎯 **TRICKY INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

### **Question 1: The NULL Trap**
**Question:** "What's wrong with this query and how would you fix it?"
```sql
SELECT EmployeeName 
FROM Employees 
WHERE DepartmentID NOT IN (
    SELECT DepartmentID 
    FROM Departments 
    WHERE Status = 'Inactive'
);
```

**What Interviewer is Testing:**
- Understanding of NULL behavior in subqueries
- Knowledge of three-valued logic in SQL
- Ability to choose safer alternatives

**Answer:**
"The issue is that if the subquery returns any NULL values, the entire NOT IN condition becomes UNKNOWN, resulting in no rows returned. A safer approach is to use NOT EXISTS or filter out NULLs:"

```sql
-- Solution 1: Use NOT EXISTS (Recommended)
SELECT EmployeeName 
FROM Employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Departments d 
    WHERE d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID 
    AND d.Status = 'Inactive'
);

-- Solution 2: Filter NULLs
SELECT EmployeeName 
FROM Employees 
WHERE DepartmentID NOT IN (
    SELECT DepartmentID 
    FROM Departments 
    WHERE Status = 'Inactive'
    AND DepartmentID IS NOT NULL  -- Critical fix
);
```

### **Question 2: Performance Showdown**
**Question:** "When would you use EXISTS instead of IN, and vice versa?"

**What Interviewer is Testing:**
- Understanding of query performance
- Knowledge of execution plans
- Practical experience with large datasets

**Answer:**
"EXISTS is generally better when:
1. The subquery result set is large
2. You have proper indexes on joined columns
3. You only need to check existence

IN is better when:
1. The subquery result set is small
2. The result can be cached
3. You need the actual values for other operations

EXISTS stops at first match, while IN must process all results."

### **Question 3: Correlated vs Non-Correlated**
**Question:** "Rewrite this correlated subquery as a non-correlated one and explain the performance implications."

```sql
-- Original correlated
SELECT e1.EmployeeName, e1.Salary
FROM Employees e1
WHERE e1.Salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.Salary)
    FROM Employees e2
    WHERE e2.Department = e1.Department
);
```

**Answer:**
```sql
-- Non-correlated using JOIN
WITH DeptAverages AS (
    SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) as AvgSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department
)
SELECT e.EmployeeName, e.Salary
FROM Employees e
JOIN DeptAverages da ON e.Department = da.Department
WHERE e.Salary > da.AvgSalary;
```

**Performance Analysis:**
"Correlated subquery: O(n*m) complexity - runs once per row
Non-correlated with JOIN: O(n) + O(m) - runs once each, much more efficient"

### **Question 4: The Multiple Row Problem**
**Question:** "This scalar subquery is failing. Why and how to fix?"
```sql
SELECT EmployeeName,
       (SELECT DepartmentName FROM Departments) as DeptName  -- ERROR!
FROM Employees;
```

**Answer:**
"The subquery returns multiple rows but is used in a scalar context. Solutions:"

```sql
-- Solution 1: Ensure single row with WHERE
SELECT EmployeeName,
       (SELECT DepartmentName FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID) as DeptName
FROM Employees e;

-- Solution 2: Use aggregation
SELECT EmployeeName,
       (SELECT MAX(DepartmentName) FROM Departments) as DeptName  -- Not ideal
FROM Employees;

-- Solution 3: Use JOIN (Best approach)
SELECT e.EmployeeName, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

## 🔄 **COMMON PATTERNS AND APPROACHES**

### **Pattern 1: Existence Checking**
**Use Case:** Find records that have/don't have related records

**Approach:**
```sql
-- Pattern
SELECT *
FROM main_table m
WHERE EXISTS/NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM related_table r 
    WHERE r.foreign_key = m.primary_key
    AND additional_conditions
);
```

### **Pattern 2: Comparative Analysis**
**Use Case:** Find records above/below average

**Approach:**
```sql
-- Pattern
SELECT *
FROM table t
WHERE value >/< ANY/ALL (
    SELECT comparative_value
    FROM comparative_table
    WHERE conditions
);
```

### **Pattern 3: Hierarchical Data**
**Use Case:** Find tree structures or reporting chains

**Approach:**
```sql
-- Using correlated subquery for hierarchy depth
SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees e2 
        WHERE e2.EmployeeID = e1.ManagerID) as IsManager
FROM Employees e1;
```

### **Pattern 4: Data Quality Checks**
**Use Case:** Find orphans, duplicates, or data inconsistencies

**Approach:**
```sql
-- Find orphan records
SELECT *
FROM child_table c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM parent_table p 
    WHERE p.id = c.parent_id
);

-- Find duplicates
SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*)
FROM table
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## ⚡ **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES**

### **1. Indexing for Subqueries**
```sql
-- Correlated subquery performance
CREATE INDEX idx_department ON Employees(Department);
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_salary ON Employees(Department, Salary);

-- EXISTS subquery performance  
CREATE INDEX idx_foreign_key ON related_table(foreign_key);
```

### **2. Rewriting Strategies**
**Instead of:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

**Consider:**
```sql
SELECT t1.* FROM table1 t1
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 t2 WHERE t2.id = t1.id AND condition);
```

### **3. Using CTEs for Complex Subqueries**
```sql
WITH filtered_data AS (
    SELECT id, value 
    FROM large_table 
    WHERE complex_condition
)
SELECT main.*
FROM main_table main
JOIN filtered_data fd ON main.id = fd.id;
```
